
Although I'm willing to slash my salary, I want to work my way back to Autodesk Salary. I'm willing to work with equity in companies.
No equity in shopbot
50% equity in paramcad
100% in transforms

I want ParamCAD to be a profitable company - at some point.

I don't have to be CEO, but I do want to be a major stake holder. And I want to influence business strategy as well as technical infrastructure.


Some Big Open Questions

  Who's the boss?
  Who pays for accounting, hardware, travel, attorney?
  How is hiring managed?


Should Transforms own some of the tech and license it to ParamCAD?

Expecting at least one year, more than one developer

Not seeing advantage to transforms?
 
perhaps shopbot just contracts paramcad
 
One last point: the 80/20 rule  - I showed 20% of the work that needs to happen
   I don't want to give the impression that these tools are production ready.
