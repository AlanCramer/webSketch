1. Load image, e.g two shapes, extra line at the bottom for toolpaths
2. canvas positioning confused
3. image (toolpaths) go out of bounds, some painful calculation loop
4. on load image - old path is shown
5. direction algorithm fail sometimes - smallerStool, toolbit = 6
6. onloadimage - convert to greyscale
6.1 invert image should force greyscale
7. Go3D should update scene
8. Path needs to be 3D
