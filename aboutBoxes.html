        <h2> See the Layout, See the assembly</h2>
        <h4> This is an under served "sweet spot" of design with CNC in mind. </h4>
        <p>    
            Today we have parameters that drive the 2D geometry and the layout. 
            The 3D view shows geometry and tool paths.
        </p>
         <p>
            Tomorrow we will have interactive push/pull of the 2D geometry.
            The 3D view will have the assembled version.
         </p>
         <p>
            Day after tomorrow, we will have push/pull of the 3D geometry.
